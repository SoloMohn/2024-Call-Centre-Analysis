## Project Overview

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of operational performance and customer interaction trends within the call centre. The primary objective was to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), evaluate service efficiency, and uncover actionable insights that can enhance customer satisfaction and streamline operations.

The analysis encompassed call volume patterns, agent productivity, average handling times, customer wait times, and resolution rates. Data was aggregated and examined over a defined period to pinpoint trends, fluctuations, and bottlenecks impacting service delivery.

By leveraging data analytics, the project aimed to:

- Highlight peak call periods and staffing alignment.

- Assess individual and team performance metrics.

- Identify areas of operational inefficiency.

- Recommend data-driven strategies for process optimization.

The findings offer a data-informed foundation for strategic decision-making, aimed at improving both the customer experience and internal workflow efficiency.
